				The Learning Academy mobile app is a project I've been working on recently for my current employer CCC Information Services. The idea came about because they have a Learning Management System which using Mindflash as a source. I was able to use Mindflash's API to create an Android app for their registration/course status. It is currently available in the Google Play Store.
