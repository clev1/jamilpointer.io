				Grua is another up and coming startup coming they I have been invovled with. It was one of my earliest Android projects which started 2.5 years ago. I have been slowly building out their database as well as core functionality. They have a location based service that allows tow truck companies to find potential customers. I used the Square libary Otto for event handling and Picaso for image handling/caching.<br>
